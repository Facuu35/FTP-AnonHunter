# FTP-AnonHunter
FTP-AnonHunter is a Python tool designed to automate the discovery of anonymous open FTP servers. Using Nmapâ€™s ftp-anon script, the tool scans a list of IP addresses for open FTP ports (port 21) and identifies servers that allow anonymous logins. The results are logged into an output file for easy tracking and follow-up.
